Just a recap of my basic goals and my stretch goals
:read out

Ive been able to achieve working with API, real time weather
Ive also been able to learned how to use CSS to increase the aesthetic, but due to
the timeline given, I decided to focus on interactivity, since interactivity in p5.js and processing is something that Ive not mastered yet

Ive also been able to take some feedback, taking into account color blindness by using icons, and tried to work on more interactions, comparing different cities and overtime

Ive worked on the map, and got a clear idea of how to implement it, but since Ive not been able to find out how to fit that into my sketch, so ive decided not to use it



Talk about the problems, Ive got heaps, ive recored it into a log book, from detail problems to high level problems. 

So I'll just mentioned some big high level problems

-integrating p5.js / processing with web style programming, not be able to use other great powerful libraries like chart.js, d3.js

-did also had to studied how set up a nodejs server in a simple way, got some problem with google chrome at the start

-colors, design, interfaces, definitely need to learn more about this, there is so much more to learn and the deeper i dig in, the more sophisticated it gets

-Overall, I learned a lot of new things, and plan to use this for a summer project where i can give more time, more trials, and elaborate on a lot of this.

-Animations is something i really want to do, but my skills hasnt been there yet
