Overview:
	-A project that aims to create a simple web app that present weather info in an interactive way

Data source breakdown:
	
	-Department of meteorology
	-Openweathermap API

	I did have to manually extract the information from API, and extract information from the downloaded tables through code, and excel

Analysis:

	-What interesting have I found so far ?
	I can see some specific trends of temperature and precipitation based on seasons

	-What are you trying to get out of the data?
	I am trying to extract different elements such as humidity, temperature, precipitation, from historical data out and compare it with current data

	-Are there any loose end?
	I am trynna make it a bit more interactive and still trying with different events
	and html elements

	-What is left to still investigate?
	At this point, making my visualisation is my top priority given that theres only 1 week left in the timeline

Overview of visualisation and final demo

	-Why did you choose the visualisation that you are choosing?

	Trendlines and bar charts are perfecto represent trends and volume, in this case,
	for temperature and precipitation, or humidity

	-How do the visualisation and interactions?
	 	+affect the first impression of the viewer/reader?
	 	 intuitive, trynna good choice of color and layouts so that 
	 	 the trend will stand out
	-Support your analysis?
		+There's not much on analysis and hypothesis here, but 
		I'm trynna visualise the information as good as possible, 
		so the user can spot the trends and predict future information
		at first sight

		The points im trynna make in this case maybe the temperature.
		the humidity, all of that kinda fits in with our common knowledge,
		so if something unexpected happens, you spot it right away

	-Challenges so far ?

		Openweathermap and p5.js took some time to get used to
	-Challenges to solve ?
		Trynna choose the appropriate events, UI design, still havent
		got a workflow of the app on how the user's gonna use it

		So it is a matter of connecting the functionalities together
		now for me
	-So far Ive got the platform for charts, all i gotta do is play around with maxtemp, mintemp and other stuff in the dataset
	-I planned to make a toolbar with different icons and stuff, so that the users can manipulate this objects in an easier and more engaging way, but given my timeline and limited skillset, it is just not viable through 4 weeks, so this might be something I will develop in the future


//demo: trendLineObject.js
//		dataVizObject.js
//		dataVizTotal1.js  //hit start to display stuff
